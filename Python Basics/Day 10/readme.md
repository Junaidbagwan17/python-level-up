# Step-by-step explanation of the calculator logic:

First, we created separate functions like add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide() so that each mathematical operation is handled independently. Then, we created a dictionary where the keys are operation symbols (+, -, *, /) and the values are the corresponding function names. This allowed us to select and call functions dynamically instead of using long if-elif conditions. After that, we took the first number as input from the user and entered a while loop to keep the calculator running. Inside the loop, we printed all available operation symbols from the dictionary and asked the user to choose one. We then took the next number as input and used the selected symbol to fetch the correct function from the dictionary. That function was called with the two numbers to perform the calculation and display the result. To support continuous calculations, we asked the user whether they wanted to continue. If the user chose to continue, we updated the first number with the result (num1 = answer) so that the next calculation starts from the previous result. If the user chose not to continue, we stopped the loop. This approach helped us separate logic, avoid repetition, and build a clean, reusable, and interview-ready calculator program.
